I have chosen Django and Python to accomplish this exercise, even though I don't have any prior working experience with them
except for just a few test projects that I created in my free time, I did that because I love learning new things and also 
I wanted to challenge myself by working on this exercise with technology and language that I am not familiar with, in addition to that 
I find python and Django enjoyable that have different taste than C# which I am experienced with.

I wanted to accomplish some application that gets the user best offer depending on his/her preferences, I learned more about Django and
Python, I was able to accomplish what I wanted in this short time even though my work and my family obligations made it a little bit 
hard for me to find more time. 

My application needs some enhancements that I would like to add if I had more time, like validations for fields are currntly alert 
messages they should be changed, also base url for the api is hard coded it should be a confuguration, add time picker that is supported by all browsers, add more options for user to search for an offer and finaly an auto complete 
support for city name.
